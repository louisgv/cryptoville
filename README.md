Decentralized market making for farmer, allowing farmer to announce their own price, and letting the people to be aware of the average fair price of any product. 

2 problems this idea is trying to solve:

+ The margin from the middle-man supplier between the farmer and the buyer
+ The lack of a central real-time portal for people to check the fair-price of any given product (data accessibility)

The final goal is an autonomous system of robot farmer.
